/**
 * binary_search - searches for a value in a sorted array of integers
 * using the Binary search algorithm
 * @array: is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
 * @size: is the number of elements in array
 * @value: is the value to search for
 * Return: Your function must return the index where value is located
 * You can assume that array will be sorted in ascending order
 * You can assume that value wonâ€™t appear more than once in array
 * If value is not present in array or if array is NULL,
 * your function must return -1
 * You must print the array being searched every time it changes.
 * (e.g. at the beginning and when you search a subarray)
